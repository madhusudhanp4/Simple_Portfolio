            <p>Web Developers & Designers</p>
            <p>This portfolio website is developed as part of the Web Technologies
                course where we have gained valuable skills in the Web Development
                field using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and many more. 
                This helps us showcase our skills and creativity in developing 
                interactive websites. We have included the projects developed in 
                our entire course and a brief information related to the projects. 
                We have added a contact page to let the viewers contact us about 
                their queries, etc.

                    <h3>SMART PARKING SYSTEM</h3>
                    <p>An automated car parking system is a process through which
                        car parking can be done more efficiently and easily than 
                        the manual method. The system will provide the user better 
                        services. The system counts the number of cars in the 
                        garage and checks if thereâ€™s any vacancy.</p>

                    <h3>Website Vulnerability Scanner</h3>
                    <p>A Website Vulnerability Scanner serves a pivotal role in 
                        fortifying web applications against potential security 
                        threats. Our efforts have centered on presenting the 
                        design and implementation of such a scanner. We've 
                        diligently sought out common vulnerabilities pervasive on
                        the web, encompassing threats like SQL Injection, 
                        Cross-Site Scripting, Remote Code Execution, and File 
                        Inclusion. Our focus has been on proposing an algorithm 
                        and implementing enhancements within the system to 
                        bolster the efficacy of vulnerability detection within 
                        web applications.</p>
